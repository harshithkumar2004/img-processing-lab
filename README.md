# Image Processing Lab updates and elements - OpenCV 

This repository contains basic image processing operations using OpenCV, useful for lab experiments and learning.  

## General Flow of Image Processing
1️⃣ Image Acquisition –-> Capture or load an image
2️⃣ Preprocessing –-> Resize, grayscale, denoise, enhance
3️⃣ Segmentation –-> Identify regions of interest (ROI)
4️⃣ Feature Extraction –-> Detect edges, shapes, textures
5️⃣ Processing & Analysis –-> Apply transformations, filtering, object detection
6️⃣ Post-processing –-> Refine results, adjust parameters
7️⃣ Output & Visualization –-> Display, save, or use processed data

## Operations Included

✅ Load and display an image  
✅ Resize and flip an image  
✅ Apply blur and rotation  
✅ Convert to grayscale  
✅ Detect edges using Canny  
✅ Apply thresholding
✅ Drawing quadrants
✅ Show and close image windows  

and many more..................


## Requirements  
- Python 3  
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)  

## **How to Run**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/harshithkumar2004/img-processing-lab.git
   cd img-processing-lab
   ```
2. Run the script:  
   ```sh
   python image.py
   ```  

This code is helpful for \image processing labs\ and can be modified for different experiments.
